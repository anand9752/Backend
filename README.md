# 🚀 Backend Projects Repository

Welcome to my backend projects repository! This repository contains various projects I developed while learning backend development using the MERN stack. Each folder in this repository represents a different project where I implemented various backend features, including authentication, CRUD operations, file uploads, and more.

## 📁 Folder Structure:

### 1. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization (JWT + Cookies)

- Learned about **authentication** and **authorization** using **JWT** and cookies.
- Used the **bcrypt** library to securely hash passwords.
- Created **login** and **signup** routes for both **admin** and **user** roles.

### 2. ✅ Todo App (CRUD Operations with MongoDB)

- Developed a **Todo App** to practice **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Defined routes for creating, deleting, updating, and fetching todos.
- Used **MongoDB** for storing todos.

### 3. ✍️ Blog App (Post, Like, Comment)

- Built a **Blog App** where users can:
  - **Create posts** 📝
  - **Like posts** ❤️
  - **Comment on posts** 💬
- All data (posts, likes, comments) is stored in **MongoDB**.

### 4. 🖼️ File Upload App (Cloudinary + Nodemailer)

- Created a project to **upload images and videos** to **Cloudinary**.
- Added routes for **imageReducer** and **videoReducer**.
- Used **Nodemailer** to send emails to users. 📧
